# Advent of Code 2024

This is my first time trying out advent of code.

I started out with the first two days using JavaScript and Deno for the runtime.

To run the JS code in deno, you need to grant disk read permissions: `deno --allow-read puzzle1-1.js` for example.

For day 2 and day 3 I'm trying out rust. To run: `cargo run`
